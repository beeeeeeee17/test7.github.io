source of air pollution and greenhouse gases  drawing widespread attention from atmospheric scientists and air quality managers  However  as an effort to mitigate climate change  fossil fuel combustion is being reduced in many countries  This trend seems to be accelerating  such as the ambitious rollout of electric vehicles in many countries  As a result  scientists found that volatile chemical products outweigh transportation in emission of organics in the industrialized cities of the United States  The emission flux of monoterpenes from using personal care products in New York City was comparable to that of a summertime forest  In Hong Kong  indoor cooking contributes as much to ambient organic aerosol as vehicle emissions  and many environmentally relevant species  e g   formaldehyde and monoterpenes  present indoors with higher concentrations than outdoors  These non combustion air pollution sources that are emerging with reduction of fossil fuel emissions can be classified as emerging air pollution  There is growing evidence that emerging air pollution makes considerable contributions to criteria air pollutants  e g   ozone and fine particles  PM2 5   and may have significant health and climate effects  We are committed to projects on Emerging Air pollution and Sustainable Environment

Unit  特首政策組  of HKSAR  The proposal entitled  What Are the Implications of COVID 19 Restrictions for Ozone Pollution Control in Hong Kong   aims to study the changes in ozone polution and ozone formation chemistry in response to different levels of COVID 19 restrictions in mainland and HK  The innovation of this project lies in two aspects  First  the idea of comparing the impacts of COVID 19 restrictions on ozone pollution between Guangdong and Hong Kong is novel  Although the COVID 19 s implications on ozone air pollution control were extensively studied  the effects of different levels of restriction were seldom explored  The comparison will tell  a tale of two cities   Moreover  while some studies shed light on the impacts of COVID 19 lockdown on transboundary transport of ozone  the resulting changes in ozone formation regime and sensitivity in downwind regions were not studied  Second  explainable machine learning  ML  will be applied to the large amounts of observational data in Guangdong and HK  With the ML  we will deconvolve the complicated factors that shaped the changes in ozone and ozone precursors during the COVID 19

It is designed to be small  yet full featured  enabling you to provide a great search experience without the need for external  server side  search services  lunr js has no external dependencies

uncompressed lunr min js   minified Pipeline Every document and search query that enters lunr is passed through a text processing pipeline  The pipeline is simply a stack of functions that perform some processing on the text  Pipeline functions act on the text one token at a time  and what they return is passed to the next function in the pipeline  By default lunr adds a stop word filter and stemmer to the pipeline  You can also add your own processors or remove the default ones depending on your requirements  The stemmer currently used is an English language stemmer  which could be replaced with a non English language stemmer if required  or a Metaphoning processor could be added  var index   lunr function      this pipeline add function  token  tokenIndex  tokens       text

current token being processed  the index of that token in the array of tokens  and the whole list of tokens part of the document being processed  This enables simple unigram processing of tokens as well as more sophisticated n gram processing  The function should return the processed version of the text  which will in turn be passed to the next function in the pipeline  Returning undefined will prevent any further processing of the token  and that token will not make it to the index  Tokenization Tokenization is how lunr converts documents and searches into individual tokens  ready to be run through the text processing pipeline and entered or looked up in the index  The default tokenizer included with lunr is designed to handle general english text well  although application  or language specific tokenizers can be used instead  Stemming Stemming increases the recall of the search index by reducing related words down to their stem  so that non exact search terms still match relevant documents  For example  search    searching  and  searched  all get reduced to the stem  search   lunr automatically includes a stemmer based on Martin Porter s algorithms  Stop words Stop words are words that are very common and are not useful in differentiating between documents  These are automatically removed by lunr  This helps to reduce the size of the index and improve search speed and accuracy  The default stop word filter contains a large list of very common words in English  For best results a corpus specific stop word filter can also be added to the pipeline  The search algorithm already penalises more common words  but preventing them from entering the index at all can be very beneficial for both space and speed performance  Code by Oliver Nightingale Code
